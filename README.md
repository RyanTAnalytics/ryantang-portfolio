### About Me
Hi there, fellow data enthusiast! I'm Ryan, an aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Psychology. This combination gives me a unique edge in understanding data and the stories it tells about human behavior.

During my studies, I dived deep into research methods, statistical analysis, and data interpretation, using tools like RStudio, Qualtrics, and Excel. I've had hands-on experience with both qualitative and quantitative projects, which has sharpened my skills in data collection, analysis, and visualization.

I'm all about finding those hidden gems in complex datasets and turning them into actionable insights. My psychology background helps me see the patterns and trends that others might miss. I'm a detail-oriented and curious learner, always eager to try new data techniques and solve real-world problems.

I'm excited to bring my analytical skills and a dash of psychological insight to the table, helping to drive smart, impactful decisions and make a real difference. Let's turn data into stories and insights together!
