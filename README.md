## üë®‚Äçüíº About Me
Hi there, fellow data enthusiast! I'm Ryan, an aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Psychology. This combination gives me a unique edge in understanding data and the stories it tells about human behavior.

During my studies, I dived deep into research methods, statistical analysis, and data interpretation, using tools like RStudio, Qualtrics, and Excel. I've had hands-on experience with both qualitative and quantitative projects, which has sharpened my skills in data collection, analysis, and visualization.

I'm all about finding those hidden gems in complex datasets and turning them into actionable insights. My psychology background helps me see the patterns and trends that others might miss. I'm a detail-oriented and curious learner, always eager to try new data techniques and solve real-world problems.

I'm excited to bring my analytical skills and a dash of psychological insight to the table, helping to drive smart, impactful decisions and make a real difference. Let's turn data into stories and insights together!

## Python
### [Data Analysis of Brazilian E-Commerce Dataset with Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tl5_W9UquLwBI2cOb1xKGSsOblcCQ7Ax?usp=sharing)
This was an independent project where I conducted a comprehensive data analysis from asking questions to providing suggestions using Pandas and Matplotlib in Python. 
* The analysis was done on the Brazilian ecommerce public dataset of orders made at Olist Store that can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data?select=olist_order_items_dataset.csv).
* The analysis focused on data from 2017 which had with over 70k datapoints.
* Processes include: Data Inspection (shape, info), Data Summaries (describe, value counts), Data Transformation & Wrangling (Identifying missing data and filling them in), Merging Data (Joining), Data Cleaning (Converting data types, defining functions to further break down categories), Data Analysis (Grouping and Summarizing), Data Visualization (bar graphs, line graphs), Conclusions & Suggestions (visualization interpretion).
* The complete code can be viewed [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tl5_W9UquLwBI2cOb1xKGSsOblcCQ7Ax?usp=sharing) or by clicking on the title.

## RStudio
### [Analysis of Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data using RStudio](RStudio/capstone_project.html)
This was an independent project where I conducted a analysis of a publically available fitness tracker dataset using tidyverse and other packages completed as part of the capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
* The analysis was conducted on the fitbit fitness tracker public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit/data)
* Processes include: Identifying the business task and key stakeholders, Data Summaries, Data Visualization (scatter plots, line graphs, bar charts), High-Level Recommendations.
* The complete code can be viewed [here](RStudio/capstone_project.html) or by clicking on the title.

### [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using RStudio](RStudio/EDA_with_Rstudio.html)
This was a quantitive research project with 6 memberse where an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on RStudio with essential packages like tidyverse and ggplot completed as part of Data Analytics for Psychology coursework.
* Research Title: The Relationship between Family Size and Depression, Gender as Moderator
* Train samples were provided with over 32k observations.
* Processes include: Data Extraction (view, glimpse), Data Selection, Data Screening (skim), Data Wrangling and Preparation (mutate, filter), Data Analysis (describe, counts), Data Visualization (histogram, boxplots).
* The complete code can be viewed [here](RStudio/EDA_with_Rstudio.html) or by clicking on the title.

### [Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) using RStudio](RStudio/CDA_with_RStudio.html)
Continuing from the previously done EDA, a confirmatory data analysis (CDA) was conducted on RStudio to test the hypotheses completed as part of Data Analytics for Psychology coursework.
* Research Title: The Relationship between Family Size and Depression, Gender as Moderator
* Test samples were provided with over 32k observations.
* Models and Analyses include: Moderation Analysis via Linear Regression, Assumption Testing, Model Fitting, Reliability Analysis (alpha model)
* The predictive metrics were obtained and the model was optimized using k-fold cross-validation.
* The complete code can be viewed [here](RStudio/CDA_with_RStudio.html) or by clicking on the title.

## Spreadsheets
### [Data Analysis of Bike Sales Dataset using Excel](Spreadsheets/Excel Project Dataset.xlsx)
This was an independent project where an analysis was conducted on a bike sales company using functions and tools like PivotTables to summarize data and create visualizations.
* The raw data contained around 1k observations and can be downloaded [here](Spreadsheets/Raw Data.xlsx).
* Simple, insightful visualizations were created from Pivot Tables and a comprehensive dashboard was built for the company to understand their customer demographics better.
* Processes include: Recoming duplicates/nulls, Find and Replace, Changing data format, Creating categories with `IF` statements, Creating PivotTables, Adding Charts, Building Dashboards.
* The excel file can be downloaded [here](Spreadsheets/Excel Project Dataset.xlsx) or by clicking on the title.
